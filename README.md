MH4U US cheat plugin for NTR CFW

Tested with BootNTR.cia (NTR 3.0), N3DS XL emunand 9.0 Gateway, MH4U US cia version. Base on cell9's Zelda cheat plugin and base pointer of Seeker14491. Because Seeker base pointer is "not so base", so in some mission the plugin just doesn't work. In that case you have to try a difference mission.

Features:
Press SELECT + UP:
- Set all items on first 3 pages of item pouch and gunner pouch. I ignore extra pouch because I just don't want crappy items add to storage each time I complete a hunt.
- Display the first large monster's HP as first item's quantity in item pouch. Just set first item on lower screen item shortcut to view main monster's HP at all time during the hunt.
- Set to max and freeze your stamina
- Freeze your sharpness
Press SELECT + R + UP:
- Max long sword gauge after one hit
- Make long sword glow red after first spirit-4 hit (Still, the timer from the white glow make the red gauge overflow)
Press SELECT + R + RIGHT:
- Max C.Blade charge gauge
- Set C.Blade number of phial to 6
- Max C.Blade shield glow red

Usage:
Copy file cheat.plg to /plugin/0004000000126300/ in microsd card, boot to NTR and press the trigger button combination during the hunt to enable cheats. Press the trigger button combination again during hunt and the cheats is off. After a mission, the cheats also automatically off. Press the trigger button combination anytime outside the hunt the plugin do nothing.
